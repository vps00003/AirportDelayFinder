# **Web & Razor Page Descriptions**

## Pages

### 1 - Home Page (**_VIVEK SRIRAM_**)
welcomes the user to the site and gives a brief overview of the purpose of the web app
* VIVEK SRIRAM worked on this page
  
### 2 - Delay Finder Informational Page (**_VIVEK SRIRAM_**)
provides background information about main causes of weather related flight delay and potential regions where delays are more likely
* VIVEK SRIRAM worked on this page

### 3 Airline Post Page {USER CREATED API INTEGRATED BY **_VIVEK SRIRAM_**}
allows the user to post information about an airline to the database/site, integrating the POST airports API. Utilized CRUD to allow for incorporation into site.
* VIVEK SRIRAM worked on this page

### 4 Airport Post Page {USER CREATED API INTEGRATED BY **_VIVEK SRIRAM_**}
allows the user to post information about an airport to the database/site, integrating the POST airports API. Utilized CRUD to allow for incorporation into site.
* VIVEK SRIRAM worked on this page
  
### 5 Flight Post Page {USER CREATED API INTEGRATED BY **_TYLER MCCOY_**} 
allows the user to post information about an specific route to the database/site, doesn't integrate an api we created for assignment 4 but we felt that a POST flight api would be a reasonable alternative to include on the site.
* TYLER MCCOY worked on this page
  
### 6 (Page concept for future development, since all APIs were not created into razor pages...)

General weather advisory information page {FUTURE PLAN FOR USER CREATED & EXTERNAL API INTEGRATION}- This page was initially intended to include APIs for searchDelay and delay-rating-greater-than, allowing users to search for specific metrics about airline delays. However, we faced greater than expected challenges in incorporating the 'search bar' feature into these pages. Thus, these APIs our not yet integrated, and will be part of our future vision to develop the web application if funding is secured along with external weather radar api integration
