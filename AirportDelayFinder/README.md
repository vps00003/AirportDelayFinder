# **Web & Razor Page Descriptions**

## Pages

### 1 - Home Page (****_VIVEK SRIRAM_ & TYLER MCCOY****__)
Welcomes the user to the site and gives a brief overview of the purpose of the web app. Incorporates a novel css feature by way of a 'typewriter' style welcome banner that rolls across the screen. Includes some images and charts to fill some space and give the user other content to look at. This is where we incorporate our 'collaborate' initiatve for our web design, we persent a message asking users to contribute to the site and then display links to input airports, airlines, and flights into our database.

### 2 - Delay Finder Informational Page (**_VIVEK SRIRAM_**)
Provides background information about main causes of weather related flight delay and potential regions where delays are more likely. Includes the rudamentary functional design for what the searchdelay api would have looked like on the front end, had it been integrated. Allows the user to select the date using an implemented calendar, and provides a dropdown menu for them to select an airport. These features are not yet functional but they could be used in future development with more time and resources.

### 3 Airline Post Page {USER CREATED API INTEGRATED BY **_VIVEK SRIRAM_**}
This functional page allows the user to post information about an airline to the database/site, integrating the POST airports API. Utilized CRUD to allow for seemless incorporation into site.

### 4 Airport Post Page {USER CREATED API INTEGRATED BY **_VIVEK SRIRAM_**}
This functional page allows the user to post information about an airport to the database/site, integrating the POST airports API. Utilized CRUD to allow for seemless incorporation into site.

### 5 Flight Post Page {USER CREATED API INTEGRATED BY **_TYLER MCCOY_**} 
Allows the user to post information about an specific route to the database/site, doesn't integrate an api we created for assignment 4 but we felt that a POST flight api would be a reasonable alternative to include on the site.

### 6 (Page concept for future development, since all APIs were not created into razor pages...)

General weather advisory information page {FUTURE PLAN FOR USER CREATED & EXTERNAL API INTEGRATION}- This page was initially intended to include APIs for searchDelay and delay-rating-greater-than, allowing users to search for specific metrics about airline delays. However, we faced greater than expected challenges in incorporating the 'search bar' feature into these pages. Thus, these APIs our not yet integrated, and will be part of our future vision to develop the web application if funding is secured along with external weather radar api integration
