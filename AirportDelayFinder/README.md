### 3
Flight Post Page {USER CREATED API INTEGRATED} - allows the user to post information about an specific route to the database/site, doesn't integrate an api we created for assignment 4 but we felt that a POST flight api would be a reasonable alternative to include on the site.

### 6

General weather advisory information page {EXTERNAL API INTEGRATED}- This page was initially intended to include APIs for searchDelay and delay-rating-greater-than, allowing users to search for specific metrics about airline delays. However, we faced greater than expected challenges in incorporating the 'search bar' feature into these pages. Thus, these APIs our not yet integrated, and will be part of our future vision to develop the web application if funding is secured. Instead this page houses our external api integration, a searchable weather api.
