# **DELAYFINDER**
## App Overview
This application is designed to be a collaborative travel information platform. Our vision was to create a platform where users can enter their own ratings on the delay performance of specific airlines, airports, and flight routes; therefore, allowing other users to view this information and make informed decisions. Our intial prototype of the platform incorporates several created APIs in order to allow for the collaborative user-entry features of the platform.
